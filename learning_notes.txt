--what "ffmpeg -re" does?
The -re flag in FFmpeg stands for "read input at native frame rate" and it has a specific purpose:
When you use -re, FFmpeg reads the input file at its native frame rate rather than as fast as possible. This simulates a live input stream by pacing the reading of the input file.
This is particularly useful when:

Streaming media: If you're streaming to a server or another destination, -re ensures you don't overwhelm the destination by sending frames too quickly.
Simulating live sources: For testing streaming setups, -re makes a pre-recorded file behave more like a live camera or microphone input.
Rate control: It helps maintain proper timing relationships between frames when streaming pre-recorded content.

In your specific RTP streaming command, -re is important because:

Without it, FFmpeg would read the entire input file as quickly as possible and stream it out at maximum speed
With it, FFmpeg maintains the correct timing, making the stream behave as if it were being generated in real-time

This is especially important when streaming to applications or services that expect real-time media feeds at their native frame rates.

--what would happen if "FFmpeg would read the entire input file as quickly as possible and stream it out at maximum speed"
If FFmpeg reads the entire input file as quickly as possible and streams it out at maximum speed (without the -re flag), several problems would occur:

Buffer overflow - The receiving end would be overwhelmed with data coming in too quickly, potentially causing buffer overflows and packet loss.
Playback issues - The receiving application would receive frames much faster than they should be played back, causing:

Video playing at extremely high speeds
Audio becoming incomprehensible
Synchronization problems between audio and video


Resource consumption - It would consume excessive network bandwidth in bursts rather than distributing it evenly over time.
Server rejection - Many streaming servers have rate limiting and would reject or disconnect a stream sending data too quickly.
Timestamp problems - RTP packets include timestamps that help maintain proper playback timing. Without controlled pacing, these timestamps would be incorrect.

For example, if you have a 1-minute video file and stream it without -re, the entire file might be streamed in just a few seconds. The receiving end would get 1 minute worth of content compressed into those few seconds, making proper playback impossible.
This is why the -re flag is essential for any streaming scenario where you're using a file as input but want it to behave like a live source.

***buffer overflows
In programming and information security, a buffer overflow or buffer overrun is an anomaly whereby a program writes data to a buffer beyond the buffer's allocated memory, overwriting adjacent memory locations.
A buffer overflow (or buffer overrun) occurs when the volume of data exceeds the storage capacity of the memory buffer
